### 🧠 Key Analytical Goals
1. Demonstrate analytical capabilities of Google Cloud Platform to store, connect and analyze data. 
2. Clean and structure player data from multiple sources and analyze to find key insights.

-- PART I: SCHOOL ANALYSIS
1. In each decade, how many schools were there that produced players?
2. What are the names of the top 5 schools that produced the most players?
3. For each decade, what were the names of the top 3 schools that produced the most players?

-- PART II: SALARY ANALYSIS
1. Find the top 20% of teams in terms of average annual spending
2. For each team, show the cumulative sum of spending over the years
3. Return the first year that each team's cumulative spending surpassed 1 billion.

-- PART III: PLAYER CAREER ANALYSIS
1. For each player, calculate their age at their first game, their last game, and their career length (all in years). Sort from longest career to shortest career.
2. What team did each player play on for their starting and ending years?
3. How many players started and ended on the same team and also played for over a decade?

-- PART IV: PLAYER COMPARISON ANALYSIS
1. Which players have the same birthday?
2. Create a summary table that shows for each team, what percent of players bat right, left and both
3. How have average height and weight at debut game changed over the years, and what's the decade-over-decade difference?
